Quick Sort I Runtime: O(n log( n)) average, O(n2
) worst case. Memory: 0( log(n)). 
In quick sort we pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers that are less than the 
partitioning element come before all elements that are greater than it. The partitioning can be performed 
efficiently through a series of swaps
