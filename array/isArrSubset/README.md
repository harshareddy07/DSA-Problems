Given two arrays a[] and b[], your task is to determine whether b[] is a subset of a[].

Examples:
<pre>
Input: a[] = [11, 7, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7, 3], b[] = [11, 3, 7, 1, 7]    
Output: true  
Explanation: b[] is a subset of a[]  
</pre>

<pre>
Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6], b[] = [1, 2, 4]  
Output: true  
Explanation: b[] is a subset of a[]  
</pre>

<pre>
Input: a[] = [10, 5, 2, 23, 19], b[] = [19, 5, 3]   
Output: false
