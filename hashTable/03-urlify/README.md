**URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string 
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" 
length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can 
perform this operation in place.)**


EXAMPLE 

Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13 
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith" 


How:

The algorithm employs a two-scan approach. In the first scan, we 
count the number of spaces. By tripling this number, we can compute how many extra characters we will 
have in the final string. In the second pass, which is done in reverse order, we actually edit the string. When 
we see a space, we replace it with %20. If there is no space, then we copy the original character.
