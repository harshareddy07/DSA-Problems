Given an array arr[] of integers and another integer target. Determine if there exist two distinct indices such that the sum of their elements is equal to the target.

**Examples:**

Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2 
Output: true  
Explanation: arr[3] + arr[4] = -3 + 1 = -2  

Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0
Output: false 
Explanation: None of the pair makes a sum of 0 

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105
-105 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
-2*105 ≤ target ≤ 2*105
