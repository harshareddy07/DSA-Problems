Given an array arr[] of integers and another integer target. Determine if there exist two distinct indices such that the sum of their elements is equal to the target.

**Examples:**
<pre>
Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2
Output: true  
Explanation: arr[3] + arr[4] = -3 + 1 = -2  
</pre>  

<pre>
Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0  
Output: false  
Explanation: None of the pair makes a sum of 0
